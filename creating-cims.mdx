## Step-by-Step CIM Creation

Follow these steps to generate your first CIM using AI automation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Business Details" icon="edit-3">
    Navigate to the Dashboard and click `Create New CIM`.

    Provide:
    - Business notes (e.g., "Tech startup with 50% YoY growth, $5M ARR, seeking $10M Series A")
    - Website URL (e.g., `https://exampletech.com`)

    Click `Generate with AI`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review AI Output" icon="eye">
    The platform scrapes the website and combines it with your notes to produce a draft CIM.

    Scan sections like Executive Summary, Financials, and Market Opportunity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Draft" icon="save">
    Save as a draft or publish directly. Add eSignature fields if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reviewing and Editing Content

AI generates high-quality drafts, but you control the final version. Use the editor to refine content.

  <Tab title="Basic Edits" icon="edit">
    Modify text directly in the WYSIWYG editor. Highlight sections to regenerate with AI prompts like "Expand on SDE analysis".

    - EBITDA Margin: 25%
    ```
